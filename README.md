## Description

This is a destruction minigame and tech-demo made for the [Tech Jam 1](https://sbox.game/c/tech1). It's my first s&box project. The idea was to build a complete but small minigame for others to see, try and eventually use as example.

In this minigame you can build, alone or with other players, 3 siege machine each. You can choose between a Catapult and a Trebuchet. They fire a different projectile at different speeds, as in real life the Trebuchet projectile is bigger and much heavier. You can rotate the siege machine left/right and change the fire power, that allow you to fire closer/farther.

The objective would be to destroy every single castle piece (_but that take too much time so I doubt anyone is actually gonna do it because the game is not so balanced towards that_).

For performance reasons the debris disappear after only 5s, it was cool to have a pile of debris but the framerate sadly wouldn't like so many complex rigid-bodies.

## Development history

I read about the [Tech Jam 1](https://sbox.game/c/tech1) on [Twitter](https://fxtwitter.com/garrynewman/status/1872222504464314807) around Christmas 2024, but at the time I did not pay much attention to it.
It was during the first days of 2025 that I begun seriously thinking about what could I make.

The only problem was that I **never** touched the Source Engine, Garry's Mod or s&box before, so I had to start completely from scratch. Because of that little pieces of this project are copied/inspired by [Facepunch battlebugs minigame](https://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-battlebugs), as the mouse input logic or the general waiting-playing-result GameState.
I recommend every new developer to check out Facepunch's example as they provide some nice insights about how to develop some parts.

Thinking and browsing Kenney's assets I decided to do some destruction with the Castle Kit. At this point I had lots of ideas: maybe you can build your own castle; or you have to destroy each other's castle, built or not vs the AI or another player; or maybe the castle is gonna be randomly generated;

Doing the firsts destruction tests, I understood that the easies thing to do with the time I had was everyone attacking a single castle together, and so I implemented that. I have to admit half the work was creating, importing and setting up the models correctly.

There have been multiple logic changes about the projectile/destructible logic, some of which are written in the [Wiki](#wiki-anchor).

## Controls

Most of the game is played using the mouse, there are a few keys you can use:

- Mouse Left Click: Click all the UI buttons and select the tiles to build to;
- Mouse Right Click: De-Select the currently selected tile;
- Keyboard <kbd>F</kbd>: Enable the free movement Camera to look around (while playing) - unfortunately can't be rotated;
- Keyboard <kbd>R</kbd>: Disable the free movement Camera and resets it to the original player view (while playing);
- Keyboard <kbd>W</kbd>/<kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>S</kbd>/<kbd>D</kbd>: Move the free movement Camera around.

You can find a summary of the used in the [ASSETS](ASSETS.md) file.

## Problems and Improvements

The game is not perfect as it was made for a Jam in a little time with an Engine I am not familiar with.

If you want to report a problem, or if you want to improve it with a new feature, a fix, or a new map, free to open an Issue, a PullRequest or a Discussion.

Remember the game was developed with the developer preview of s&box and might break or no longer be playable in the future.
